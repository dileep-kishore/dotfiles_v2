    Dotfiles for my <strike><a href="https://xmonad.org/">Xmonad</a></strike> <a href="https://awesomewm.org/">AwesomeWM</a> setup on my <a href="https://archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a> system, managed by <a href="https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi">chezmoi</a>

## Setup

- `Arch Linux` (any other Arch based distribution should also work)
- `Awesome` window manager
- `Zsh` as the default shell with [Zinit](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit) as the plugin manager and [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) for the prompt
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) as the terminal text editor managed with `Packer.nvim`
- ~~`Emacs` as the default text editor using the `Doom Emacs` distribution~~. `Neovim` as the default text editor (the new `Lua` plugins are rad). Startup times are close to 150 ms even with 90 plugins.
- Current theme: [TokyoNight](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim)
- Current terminals: [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) (default for now because I love my ligatures) with `tmux`

## Installation

```sh
chezmoi init https://github.com/dileep-kishore/dotfiles
```

The [dependency script](run_once_install-packages.sh) only supports `Arch Linux` and its derivatives.
If you install the dependencies manually, then the `dotfiles` can be used in any `Linux` setup.

> NOTE:
> You might want to turn off the shutter scripts (killer.sh) in `.xprofile` and `xmonad.hs`. They should technically should not run unless your hostname matches mine.
