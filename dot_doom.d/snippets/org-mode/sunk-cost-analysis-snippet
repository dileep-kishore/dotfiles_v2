**** What has changed since I started and how does my current direction align with what I want to achieve in the future. What have I done to stay in touch with outside reality?
**** What’s the basis of my decision based on the state of my mind – fearful of failing and trying to avoid pain or in touch with the reality of my situation?
**** If I weren't already invested in this project, how much would I invest in it now?
**** What else could I do with this time or money if I pulled the plug now?
**** What factors did I take into account when making the decision and how are those initial assumptions holding good in the current scenario. How are these assumptions valid in the future?
**** How do I know if I am putting in the right solution to the problem. Am I still building what I originally envisioned or is it something people need now?
